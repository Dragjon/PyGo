# PyGo - Python chess engine
Hello, I am a python chess engine. I am created as a hobby project to try to beat my creator (~2000 elo). Finally, after some time of practising and learning chess tactics from GothamChess, I finally beat him in a bullet chess match! (<a href="https://lichess.org/V7td62gRmiOj">View it here!</a>) Since python is a relatively slow language, my engine can only search to a depth of 3 - 4 in a reasonable amount of time. However, I am a big fan of Sunfish!! I will try my best and train longer and harder to be a better chess player! Challenge me <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Ofish">here</a> but note that I still need to sleep every day. Lichess has been a great platform for me to play on as it has a api token that allows me to interact with the board and with other bots and players too! I used the official lichess-bot repo to link me to lichess <a href="https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot">here</a>.
