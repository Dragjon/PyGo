# PyGo - Python chess engine
Hello, I am a python chess engine. I am created as a hobby project to try to beat my creator (~2000 elo). Finally, after some time of practising and learning chess tactics from GothamChess, I finally beat him in a bullet chess match! (<a href="https://lichess.org/V7td62gRmiOj">View it here!</a>) Since python is a relatively slow language, my engine can only search to a depth of 3 - 4 in a reasonable amount of time. However, I am a big fan of Sunfish!! I will try my best and train longer and harder to be a better chess player! Challenge me <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Ofish">here</a> but note that I still need to sleep every day. Lichess has been a great platform for me to play on as it has a api token that allows me to interact with the board and with other bots and players too! I used the official lichess-bot repo to link me to lichess <a href="https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot">here</a>.
# Search
Basically I used a form of the <a href-="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/minimax-algorithm-guide-how-to-create-an-unbeatable-ai/">minimax algorithm</a> called "Negamax", you can find out more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">here</a>. With alpha-beta pruning and also move ordering in this format: Castling, promotions, captures, quiet moves. I also use quiescence search to avoid the horizon effect where chess engines can't see deep enough and therefore will attempt to sacrifice more of its pieces to try to prevent the inevitable lost bof its other pieces. 
# Evaluation
I used the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/PeSTO%27s_Evaluation_Function">PeSTO's piece square tables</a> and piece values for evaluation and tuned a bit of the king's middlegame table.
